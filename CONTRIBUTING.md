    git checkout -b fix/<your-bug-fix-name>      # For bug fixes
    ```

    *(Replace `<your-feature-name>` or `<your-bug-fix-name>` with a descriptive name for your branch.)*

4.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your code changes, fix the identified issue, or add the desired new feature.

5.  **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages, adhering to the commit message conventions:

    ```shell

    * `feat`: Introducing new features.
    * `fix`: Addressing bug fixes.
    * `docs`: Changes related to documentation.
    * `style`: Updates to code style (formatting, semicolons, etc.).
    * `refactor`: Code refactoring without introducing new features or bug fixes.
    * `test`: Changes related to tests (adding, modifying, or fixing tests).
    * `chore`: Miscellaneous changes to the build process or auxiliary tools.

7.  **Push Your Branch:** Push your local branch to your forked repository on GitHub:

    ```shell
    git push origin <your-branch-name>
    ```

    *(Replace `<your-branch-name>` with the name of your branch.)*

8.  **Open a Pull Request:**
    * Navigate to the original CMP App Recipes repository on GitHub.
    * You should see a prompt to create a pull request from your newly pushed branch.
    * Click "Compare & pull request."
    * Fill out the pull request template (if provided) with a clear and comprehensive description of your changes.
    * Click "Create pull request" to submit your contribution.

## üé® Code Style

To maintain a consistent and readable codebase, please adhere to the following style guidelines:

* **Kotlin:** Follow the [official Kotlin coding conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html).
* **Naming:** Use descriptive and consistent names for all variables, functions, classes, and other entities.
* **Comments:** Add comments to explain complex logic, non-obvious code sections, or important design decisions.
* **Formatting:** Ensure consistent code formatting and indentation. Utilize Android Studio's built-in code formatting tools (`Code > Reformat Code`).
* **Tests:** All new features and bug fixes **must** include relevant unit and/or integration tests.
* **Run Tests:** Always run all tests locally before submitting a pull request to ensure your changes haven't introduced any regressions.

## Pull Request Guidelines

To ensure a smooth review process, please follow these guidelines when submitting pull requests:

* **Keep it Small and Focused:** Aim for pull requests that address a single issue or implement a single feature. Smaller PRs are easier to review and merge.
* **Provide a Clear Description:** In your pull request, clearly describe the changes you've made, the problem you're addressing (if applicable), and the solution you've implemented.
* **Test Thoroughly:** Ensure your changes are well-tested and do not introduce any new issues.
* **Update Documentation:** If your changes modify the public API or introduce new features, update the relevant documentation accordingly.
* **Address Feedback:** Be prepared to receive feedback on your pull request and be willing to make necessary revisions based on reviewer comments.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue Guidelines

When creating or interacting with issues, please keep the following in mind:

* **Search Before Submitting:** Before opening a new issue, please search the existing issues to avoid duplicates.
* **Use a Descriptive Title:** The title of your issue should clearly and concisely summarize the problem or feature request.
* **Explain the Problem Clearly:** If you're reporting a bug, provide detailed steps to reproduce the issue, the expected behavior, and the actual behavior you observed.
* **Utilize Issue Templates:** If the project provides issue templates, please use them and fill in all the requested information.

## üí¨ Communication

* Use the GitHub issue tracker for all bug reports, feature requests, and discussions.
* Be respectful and considerate of others.
